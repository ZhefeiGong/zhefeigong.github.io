  about:             |
    Hi! At present, I am a research assistant at [MiLab](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/), advised by Donglin Wang.
    Previously, I earned my BEng in Computer Science from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), 
    and I also spent a wonderful semester as an exchange student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), 
    under the guidance of [Alexandre Alahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UIhXQ64AAAAJ&hl=en). 
    Additionally, I was privileged to work as a research intern at [IRCP Lab](https://robot.tongji.edu.cn/) during my time at Tongji.
    
    After an extensive period of exploration, 
    my interest has gravitated towards solving real-world tasks.
    Currently, I am broadly interested in **robot learning**, especially in **manipulation** tasks.
    My aspiration is to develop general-purpose robots capable of autonomously performing complex, long-term daily tasks, 
    thus transitioning them from laboratories to everyone's homes. I am dedicated to realizing this vision over the next ten years.
