    Hi! At present, I'm a visiting scholar working with [Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/).
    Previously, I was a research assistant at [MiLab](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/), advised by Donglin Wang.
    I received my BEng in Computer Science from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/),
    where I also spent a wonderful semester as an exchange student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/),
    under the guidance of [Alexandre Alahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UIhXQ64AAAAJ&hl=en).
    Additionally, I was privileged to work as a research intern at [IRCP Lab](https://robot.tongji.edu.cn/) during my time at Tongji.

    After an extensive period of exploration, my interest has gravitated towards solving real-world tasks.
    Currently, I am particularly interested in **robot learning**, **generative models** and **reinforcement learning**, with a focus on **manipulation** tasks.
    My aspiration is to develop general-purpose robots capable of autonomously performing complex, long-term daily tasks, 
    thus transitioning them from laboratories to everyone's homes. I am dedicated to realizing this vision over the next ten years.

    Actively seeking PhD opportunities for _2026 Fall_ !
    See <a href="https://zhefeigong.github.io/experience/#robotic-platforms">here</a> for details on my _real-world_ robotics research experience.
    Feel free to get in touch if our research interests overlap.
